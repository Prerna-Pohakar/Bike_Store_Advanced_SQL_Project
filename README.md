# Bike_Store_Advanced_SQL_Project

Bike Store Database – Advanced SQL Analysis Project

This project includes 20 real-world business questions solved using the Bike Store Database.
As a growing data analyst, I used this dataset to practice advanced SQL concepts such as:
1.CTEs (WITH clause)
2.Window functions (RANK, OVER)
3.Revenue, profit & discount analysis
4.Yearly comparison using conditional aggregation
5.Customer segmentation
6.Staff performance ranking
7.Category-wise and brand-wise revenue insights
8.Stock & inventory checks
9.City/State revenue breakdown

Key analyses in this project:
✔ Monthly sales revenue for 2017
✔ Top revenue-generating stores
✔ Top 3 categories by sales & units sold
✔ Brand share (%) of total units sold
✔ Staff revenue contribution + ranking
✔ Order segmentation (High / Medium / Low)
✔ Customers with more than 3 yearly orders
✔ Orders above yearly average revenue
✔ Category top-selling products using CTE + ranking
✔ Revenue growth comparison between 2016 vs 2017
✔ Most profitable brands (20% margin assumed)
✔ Low-stock product identification (<10 units)

This SQL file showcases strong skills in data cleaning, analytical SQL, business logic, and dataset exploration—a perfect project for demonstrating my capabilities as a fresher in data analytics.
